# Endpoint overrides YAML format:
# A flat list of endpoints (no tree with "children").
# "name" refers to an endpoint anywhere in the main endpoint tree.
# any other keys replace the corresponding keys in the endpoint.

# To apply modifications in this file,
# regenerate the endpoints YAML with "uv run ./scripts/update_endpoints.py".

# Note: for switches, the error message says "This endpoint only supports MS devices",
# but no error is returned for MS and C devices, not just MS devices.
